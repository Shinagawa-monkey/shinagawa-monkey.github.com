          <p class="paragraph">Robot Chicken is an American stop motion sketch comedy television series, created and executive produced for Adult Swim by Seth Green and Matthew Senreich along with co-head writers Douglas Goldstein and Tom Root. The writers, especially Green, also provide many of the voices. Senreich, Goldstein, and Root were formerly writers for the popular action figure hobbyist magazine ToyFare. Robot Chicken has won an Annie Award and six Emmy Awards.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Throughout its nine seasons, “Robot Chicken” put all of pop culture in a blender and hit the “pulverise” button. Bouncing from one erratic sketch to the next (sometimes in a matter of seconds), the stop-motion comedy makes for ideal late-night viewing. Actor Seth Green co-created the show and helped rally numerous celebrities for any given 11-12 minute episode.</p>
