          <p class="paragraph">Daria is an American adult animated sitcom created by Glenn Eichler and Susie Lewis Lynn. The series ran from March 3, 1997 to January 21, 2002 on MTV.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">“Beavis and Butt-head” regular Daria Morgendorffer got a funny adult cartoon of her own in 1997. Retaining a somewhat droll, albeit highly intelligent disposition, Daria endures as an outsider in a world brimming with dumb high schoolers and patronising adults. The series culminated in 2002 with the TV movie “Daria in ‘Is It College Yet?'”.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">In June 2019, MTV announced a new Daria spin-off series, Jodie (originally Daria & Jodie) with actress Tracee Ellis Ross starring as the titular character, as well as executive producing. The show is the first in a series of spin-offs planned by the network based on the Daria franchise.</p>
