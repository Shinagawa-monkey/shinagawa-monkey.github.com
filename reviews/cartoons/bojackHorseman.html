          <p class="paragraph">BoJack Horseman is widely considered by critics to be one of the greatest television series of all time. Despite mixed reviews upon its debut, critics were significantly more positive towards the second half of the first season, and the subsequent seasons received wide acclaim. The show is lauded for its realistic take on dealing with depression, trauma, addiction, self-destructive behavior, racism, sexism, sexuality, and the human condition.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Netflix’s first adult cartoon is arguably still the streaming platform’s best, depending on who you ask. Set in a world where talking animals and humans co-exist, it tells the story of Bojack Horseman, a once-popular TV star who now lives in a state of perpetual malaise. As Bojack navigates his way through Hollywood in search of love, success, and a reason for being, show business gets satirised from every conceivable angle.</p>
